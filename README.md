SJ Web Devs Project - Goal/Task Manager

Hi everyone! This is project 1 for the San Jose Front-End Web Developers group. This build will be a sort of life-goals and tasks manager interface. 

**Mockups of the interface can be found in the assets folder of this Repo**

Here's the basic product spec:

PURPOSE - The goals tracker is a web application meant to assist people in structuring, managing, and tracing their life goals. It is not a simple calendar program.

TARGET AUDIENCE - Pretty much anyone can use this application. If you are adverse to setting and completing goals, this is not a good web application for you. ;-)

PLATFORM - Web, Mobile

PRIMARY FEATURES -  

                    1. Users create a personal profile with a "theme" for their particular goals. The mockups are themed "Year Of Transformation".

                    2. Users are given an Annual, Monthly, Weekly, and Daily breakdown of information. Once the user chooses their big-picture annual goals, they'll be given the option to setup monthly goals which include their efforts towards completing the annual goals. This continues down to the daily goals. Here's an example:
                    
                    Joe's is a new user, his annual goals include learning French and becoming proficient at JavaScript. After setting up his profile and theme, he receives the big-picture "annual goals" field. He inputs that he want to learn French and Javascript this year. He then sees a "monthly goals" menu which asks him, "what will you do this month to help learn French?" and "what will you do this month to help learn JavaScript?" This continues on down into the daily tasks list where Joe enters very small, daily steps that help them reach their big-picture annual goals.
                    
                    Along with the goals themselves, the user can input a "priority level" for each item and also select when something is finished. Their should also be a "due date" feature.
                    
                    3. The program should also include a visual queue or progress bar to help users further visualize the their efforts.
                    
                    4. The "Off The Radar" screen can be addressed in a later iteration.
                    
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS - Account creation and user authentication mechanisms(Facebook, Google, Native). List views to input and organize each series of goals. Mechanisms to create new items inside the lists and edit any of the existing data.
